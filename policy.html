Privacy Policy - Photos Editing.

Protecting your privacy is very important to us. I hope the following statement will help you understand how Photos Editing. handles personally identifiable information ("PII") that you occasionally provide to us via the Internet ("Google Play" platform).

Generally, when you download our Android application, we will not collect any PII from you. Specifically, we do not require consumers to register before downloading the app, nor do we need to track consumer access to our app. We don't even have a server to store such PII.

PhotosEditing uses Facebook as the advertising provider. Facebook wants to show ads relevant to you. For more information, please check https://m.facebook.com/ads/ad_choices.

We can only access your PII when you personally decide to send feedback to us via email or provide us with an error report. In this case, the PII we may obtain from you is limited to your name, email address and survey response.

Under the above circumstances, we guarantee that your personally identifiable information is only used to contact you and improve our services. We will never use such information (such as your name and email address) for any other purpose, such as further selling our products or disclosing your personal information to third parties for commercial gain.

It should be noted that whether to send your feedback or error report to us is a voluntary measure that is entirely up to you. If you are worried about your PII being abused, or want to know more about our privacy policy and its meaning, please feel free to send an email to fortvalleyride@gmail.com to contact us, we will be happy to provide you with a clear answer. Deal with it in time.
